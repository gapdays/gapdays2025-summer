### Computing trivial source modules and their character tables using GAP

Let *G* be a finite group and let *k* be a large enough field of characteristic *p* dividing |*G*|. 
The trivial source *kG*-modules are precisely the indecomposable direct summands of the permutation 
*kG*-modules. It is possible to assign a well-defined ordinary character to each trivial source module. 
In this talk, we present one possible way to explicitly calculate matrix representations and the ordinary
characters of the trivial source modules using GAP. Moreover, we comment on some applications thereof.
