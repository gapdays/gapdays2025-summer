### Permutation characters from parabolic subgroups and Green functions

Green functions of finite groups of Lie type provide an important
input for computing character values of these groups.

Permutation characters from parabolic subgroups can be computed when all
Green functions of centralizers of semisimple elements are known.

The other way round, we have computed values of such permutation characters
by computations in the groups - and from this we could determine the Green
functions in the last unknown cases (for exceptional groups of type
*E<sub>8</sub>(q)*).
