### Developing a practical algorithm for GRAPE.

I'll talk about the one article I have written with Leonard, which develops theory due to Reidemeister that allows computation of 
fundamental groups, finite covers and related objects, associated with combinatorial cell complexes,
and which is available as a GRAPE package. I'll talk briefly about the theory, and also about applications of our work.
