Koper has several nearby airports.  Trieste (TRS) is the closest; Ljubljana (LJU) is nearly as close and sometimes better connected.  Venice Marco Polo (VCE) is a major international airport, and is only about 2 hours away by shuttle.  Other airports that may be worth looking at include Pula (PUY, regional airport), Venice Treviso (TSF, regional airport), Zagreb (ZAG, international airport).  All of these airports have service from the [GoOpti shuttle service ](https://www.goopti.com/en/); it is a good idea to book a GoOpti shuttle at least two weeks ahead.<br>
More advice on getting to Koper can be found on the webpage for the [12th PhD Summer School in Discrete Mathematics](https://conferences.famnit.upr.si/event/33/page/290-getting-to-koper) that will be held shortly after GAP Days.
