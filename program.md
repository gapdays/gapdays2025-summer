<p style="color:red; font-style: italic;">CAUTION: THIS IS A PREVIEW AND THINGS ARE NOT FINAL YET</p>

* __Start:__ Monday 25 August 2025 <!-- , 9:00 UTC -->
* __Finish:__ Friday 29 August 2025

We aim to have introductory sessions on GAP for students and researchers
interested to use GAP to support their research. The invited speakers will
present a minicourse addressing topics in algebra, group theory and discrete
mathematics related to GAP, and provide some exercises for the students in
parallel with working sessions for developpers. 

<!--
But we are looking for more talks, so please <a href="mailto:{{site.email}}">contact us via email</a> and let us know if you would like to give a talk about your research! We welcome talks about computational mathematics research, which utilised GAP.-->

## Minicourses

- **Minicourse 1 by Ilaria Colazzo**

1. Introduction to GAP: Basics of Computation
Topics: Basic arithmetic, programming, linear algebra, and an introduction to group theory concepts.

2. Group Theory in GAP: Permutation and Finite Groups
Topics: Permutation groups, cyclic groups, dihedral groups, symmetric groups, and alternating groups.

3. Group Theory in GAP: Matrix Groups and Homomorphisms
Topics: Matrix groups, group homomorphisms, and automorphism groups, with computational applications.

- **Minicourse 2 by Bettina Eick**

1. Finite p-groups and finite solvable groups in GAP

2. Classification of finite groups (SmallGroups / GrpConst packages)

3. The Lazard correspondence and Lie p-rings in GAP (LiePRing package)

- **Minicourse 3 by Michel Lavrauw**

1. Projective spaces over finite fields in GAP (FinInG package)

2. Coding theory in GAP (guava package)

3. Incidence geometries and substructure (FinInG package)

## Detailed schedule

We will open with a meeting at Monday morning at 9:45. Around 10:00 we coordinate plans for the week,
and follow a pattern of "Standups" each day at around 10:00 and 17:00, to
communicate what we plan to work on, and what we have worked on, respectively. There will be two lectures of the minicourses per day 
and two hours of exercises in parallel with working sessions. 

The schedule is subject to further changes.
