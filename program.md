We aim to have introductory sessions on GAP for students and researchers
interested to use GAP to support their research. The invited speakers will
present a minicourse addressing topics in algebra, group theory and discrete
mathematics related to GAP, and provide some exercises for the students in
parallel with working sessions for developpers. 

<!--
But we are looking for more talks, so please <a href="mailto:{{site.email}}">contact us via email</a> and let us know if you would like to give a talk about your research! We welcome talks about computational mathematics research, which utilised GAP.

## Detailed schedule

We will open with a meeting on Monday morning at 9:00. Around 9:30 we will coordinate plans for the week.
We will have "standups" each day at around 9:30 and 17:00, to
communicate what we plan to work on, and what we have worked on, respectively.

There will be a limited amount of room on the schedule for contributed talks.

The schedule is subject to further changes.
